    <h2>Uncharted 4</h2>
    <p>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a 2016 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published 
        by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is the fourth main entry in the Uncharted series. 
        Set several years after the events of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, players control Nathan Drake, a
        former treasure hunter coaxed out of retirement by his presumed-dead brother Samuel. With Nathan's 
        longtime partner, Victor Sullivan, they search for clues for the location of Henry Avery's long-lost treasure. 
        A Thief's End is played from a third-person perspective, and incorporates platformer elements. Players 
        solve puzzles and use firearms, melee combat, and stealth to combat enemies. In the online multiplayer 
        mode, up to ten players engage in co-operative and competitive modes.</p>
